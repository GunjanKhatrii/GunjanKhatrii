# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Gunjan

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm an aspiring Data Scientist with a passion for learning, exploring, and building. I'm currently diving deep into Python, SQL, and machine learning, and I'm excited to share some of the projects I've been working on here.

### ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies:
- Python & ML libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Bokeh etc.)
- SQL for data analysis and querying
- Linux OS for development and scripting

I'm still in the early stages of my data science journey â€” always experimenting, growing, and learning something new every day.

Thanks for stopping by! I hope you enjoy exploring my work. ðŸ˜Š
